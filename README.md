# project-decked-out
 
Project: Decked Out, a game inspired by (copying) Decked Out in Minecraft Hermitcraft made by TangoTek.

It has custom-made "AI" specifically for the game "Project: Decked Out". The "AI" can hear, see, and sense if the Players are nearby, instead of abstractically (is that even a word) following the Players.
